### pyDM404
<img width="40%" height="40%" src="/assets/img/pydm.png" class="page-img">
A cross platform drum machine written in Python. The pyDM404 is a semi-serious drum sequencer/machine program. The idea is to emulate the look, feel and use (not the sound) of 90â€™s drum machines. A user can create nice drum tracks with the pyDM404, or an entire song using samples.

###Crude Synth
<img width="50%" height="50%" src="/assets/img/crudesynth.png" class="page-img">
A synthesizer written in Python and playable with your computer keyboard! This a proof of concept project. There are many examples of synths made with Python, so the general functionality was expected to work. The major question was when would python be too slow to handle the semi real-time processes.
